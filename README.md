# Bullet-Physics-Integration-Project
## About
This was meant to be a physics simulator that would spawn balls for the player to interact with. However, I ran into so many different problems that I did not reach a workable state. Please take the time to at least evaluate the effort I put into this assignment despite the fact that it is so bad when it runs.
